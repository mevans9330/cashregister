Python cash register

This program lets the user see a list of products with an associated PLU,
and then enter that PLU to add it to the register.
after the user is done entering PLU's they are then prompted to 
enter the amount of money tendered and 'checkout' the items.


#Update program
Please feel free to pull and update the code if there is a better way
to implement this program.

#Thank you
